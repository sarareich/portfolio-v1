    <h2>Data Visualization</h2>

    <div class = "description">
     <p>This project, called "What's Your Impact?" was created in my Programming Basics class, where we used the <a href = "https://processing.org/" target="_blank">Processing</a> language and software to create animated and interactive designs. What's Your Impact? is an interactive data visualization intended to inform people about the environmental impacts of the foods they consume. Users can explore the impacts of consuming beef, eggs, dairy, pork, chicken and fish, as well as some environmentally friendly, plant-based alternatives.</p>
