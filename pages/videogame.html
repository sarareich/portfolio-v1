      <p>This is a video game I created called Cookie Catcher. It was created in my Programming Basics class, where we used the <a href = "https://processing.org/" target="_blank">Processing</a> language and software to create animated and interactive designs.</p>

      <p>The goal of the game is to catch as many cookies as possible while avoiding burnt cookies. Each time the user completes a level, the game increases in difficulty. Cookies fall more quickly, more burnt cookies appear, and the user has the opportunity to earn bonus points by catching brownies.</p>

      <p>The game will continue to create levels indefinitely, until the user drops too many cookies or catches too many burnt cookies in one level.</p>
