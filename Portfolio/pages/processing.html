     <p>These projects were created in my Programming Basics class, where we used the <a href = "https://processing.org/" target="_blank">Processing</a> language and software to create animated and interactive designs.</p>

      <p>This design is a piece of generative art intended to be used as a screensaver. The initial inspiration for the design was the image of dandelions with their feathery seeds being blown away. The dandelions vary in size, location on the screen, and speed of movement each time the program is run.</p>

      <p>This is a video game I created called Cookie Catcher. The goal of the game is to catch as many cookies as possible while avoiding burnt cookies. The game increases with difficulty each time you pass a level, with the addition of "bonus" brownies and burnt cookies, as well as faster speeds. You lose the game if you drop too many cookies or catch too many burnt cookies in one round.</p>
